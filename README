Parsing MPR files using Javascript & HTML5
==========================================
Video demo @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_seAK2rmuo

An example of parsing LiveForSpeed's MPR files, in Javascript using HTML5's
FileReader API + jspack (with added drag and drop magic).

Why get your users to upload a 4MB MPR file, when they can just sent you the
bits you need from the header (a few KB at most)?

Uses (and bundled):
  - Angularjs (http://angularjs.org/)
  - jspack (http://code.google.com/p/jspack/)
